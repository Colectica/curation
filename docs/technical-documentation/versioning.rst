Automatic Information Versioning
==================================

The curation tools automatically track changes to catalog records,
files, and variables. This article describes when the version number
of each object is automatically incremented.

Catalog Records
------------------

A catalog record's version number is increased when information is
edited on the :guilabel:`General` or :guilabel:`Methods` pages.

Files
------------------

A file's version is increased when a new version of the file is uploaded.

Variables
------------------

A variable's version is increased when information about the variable
is edited within the variable editor.
