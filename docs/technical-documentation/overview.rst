Overview
======================

The Colectica Curation Tools are a collection of software that allows data
archives to leverage the DDI standard for data documentation and to structure
the curation workflow, which includes checking data for confidentiality and
completeness, creating preservation formats, and reviewing and verifying
code. The new integrated system combines several open source off-the-shelf
components with a new, web-based ISPS-IPA Data Pipeline application, and enables
a seamless framework for collecting, processing, archiving, and publishing
data. Primary beneficiaries will be the research community at ISPS, IPA, and
beyond as the repository enables open access to data resources that have been
fully reviewed and enhanced for long term usability and analysis.
