Confirm Observation Counts
----------------------------------------------

The curator should confirm that number of observations in a data file
matches the number of observations the study claims to have had,
either in published articles or associated files such as codebooks or
readme files.

#. For a data file, select the :guilabel:`Review Observation Count` task.

    a. Instructions indicating how to perform this review.

    b. The number of observations in the data file, as determined by
       reading the data file and as stored in the file's metadata.

    c. A list of known documents or publications that may reference the
       observation count.

#. If the counts do not match, enter any desired comments and mark the
   review as insufficient. If authorized, you may separately make
   changes to make the counts accurate, and then perform the review
   again.
