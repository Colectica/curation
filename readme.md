# Colectica Curation Tools

The Colectica Curation Tools allow data archives to structure the curation workflow. 
The platform combines several open source and off-the-shelf components with a new,
web-based data pipeline application. The software builds on the DDI standard to
enable a seamless framework for collecting, processing, archiving, and
publishing data. The platform enables open access to data resources that have
been fully reviewed and enhanced for long term usability and analysis.

Development has been supported by the [Yale Institution for Social and Policy
Studies](https://isps.yale.edu/) and [Innovations for Poverty Action](https://poverty-action.org/).
